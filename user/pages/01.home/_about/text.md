title: "About Me"

---

Software Engineer by day, Blogger, Poet, and Author by night, I spend my days
writing everything from the convex comma, to highly complex code. I started
creatively writing poetry at the age of 10. Now I creatively write
<code>code</code>

Most of my professional career has involved *Customising [Content Management Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system)*,
but my interests are varied and I am constantly acquiring new ones. Currently,
I'm exploring [Arbitration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitration),
[Digital Marketing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_marketing), and
[Psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology), amongst other things.
