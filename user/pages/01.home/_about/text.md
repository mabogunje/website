title: "About Me"

---

Software Engineer by day, Blogger, Poet and Author, by night, I spend my days
writing everything from the convex comma, to highly complex code. More recently
however, I have found myself more deeply engrossed in technology stacks, and the
toolsets that are necessary to power business.

Most of my professional career has involved *Customising [Content Management Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system)*,
but my interests are varied and I am constantly acquiring new ones. Currently,
I'm exploring [Data Analytics](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/data-analytics.asp),
[Data Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science), and
[Business Intelligence](https://searchbusinessanalytics.techtarget.com/definition/business-intelligence-BI),
amongst other things.
