Software Engineer and Data Analyst by day, Blogger, Poet and Author, by night,
I spend my days writing everything from the convex comma, to highly complex
code. More recently however, I have found myself engrossed in the technology
stacks and toolsets necessary to power business.

Most of my professional career has involved *Customising [Content Management Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system)*,
but I am also trained in [Digital Marketing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/digital-marketing.asp), and [Data Analytics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytics).
Currently, I'm exploring the different ways by which I can apply my recently acquired Data Analytics skills.
