We help Businesses of all types, to Start, Grow, and Excel

===

My first duty when I joined TMC, was to revamp the company website. This involved:

* Simplifying our Messaging
* Establishing Version Control
* Setting Up Automated Testing, and
* Configuring Web Analytics

In addition to a complete overhaul/redesign of the front and back ends.

As of today, our new website is seeing a minimum of a 25% improvement across all engagement metrics, from bounce rate - click depth, and we expect it to keep getting better.

Results like these could soon be yours too! We intend to begin providing Technology services to local businesses in 2017.
