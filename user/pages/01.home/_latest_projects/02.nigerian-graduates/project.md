This is an analysis I performed on survey data taken from a
Kaggle Dataset of the responses of over 5000 graduates to a
set of questions investigating their post-graduate 
circumstances called the *Nigerian Graduate Report* 2018 by
Stutern.

I used R and R Markdown to perform and document my analysis. The
results are best viewed in the **Nigerian-Graduates-Analysis.html** file
or in R Studio where you can run the code chunks included in the
**Nigerian Graduates Analysis.Rmd** R Markdown file.
