This is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) I performed with a group of
fellow data analysts on Nigeria's Mineral Production from 2019 to 2020,
to discover any trends that could be useful to potential investors.

We used Microsoft Excel (online) to collaborate, perform, and
document our analysis. I led the team, but the work was divided
equally amongst team members. So I was only truly responsible for
the Excel formulae we used, and leading the presentation of our
findings. It has been copied over to Google Sheets for ease of
sharing.
