Yorùdí started life as a command-line Yoruba to English dictionary that
I developed for myself to help me learn 2 languages at once: **Scala**,
and **Yoruba**.

However in 2025, spurred on by the interest of some users, I decided to
expand the project into a live REST API and simple home page for easy use
of the dictionary. Now it lives on as a Web App hosted on Azure and GitHub
Pages.

I periodically update this app as I add new words to my dictionary all the
time! (and once in a blue moon some new features too :) )
