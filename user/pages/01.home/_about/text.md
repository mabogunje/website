title: "About Me"

---

Software Engineer by day, Blogger, Poet and Author, by night, I spend my days
writing everything from the convex comma, to highly complex code. More recently
however, I have found myself more deeply engrossed in the technology stacks and
toolsets necessary to power business.

Most of my professional career has involved *Customising [Content Management Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system)*,
but my interests are varied and I am constantly acquiring new ones. Currently,
I'm exploring [Digital Marketing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/digital-marketing.asp#:~:text=Digital%20marketing%20is%20the%20use%20of%20the%20Internet%20to%20reach,%2C%20social%20media%2C%20and%20more.)
& [Analytics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytics) amongst other things.
