This is an analysis I performed on a bike sharing company's data
to unearth the differences between their member riders and their
casual riders.

I used R and R Markdown to perform and document my analysis. The
results are best viewed in the **Bike-Share-Analysis.html** file
or in R Studio where you can run the code chunks included in the
**Bike Share Analysis.Rmd** R Markdown file.
