jQuery-YQL was an easy to use YQL plugin for jQuery which I used to power
some of the listings on the right side of this website (specifically the
anime and reading lists) by interfacing with the respective websites' APIs
directly. That is, until Yahoo retired the YQL tool this year. So I have
retired my tool too.

Note: By my standards this was still in Alpha and not fit to be shared, now that it's irrelevant though, feel
free to have a look at my code if it interests you.
