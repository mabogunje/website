jQuery-YQL was an easy to use YQL plugin for jQuery which I used to power
some of the listings on this website (specifically the anime and reading
lists) by interfacing with the respective websites' APIs directly. That is,
until Yahoo retired the YQL tool in 2019.

Note: By my standards this plugin was still in Alpha and not fit to be shared,
but now that it's irrelevant, I think it can serve as an example of the coding
I sometimes do in my free time.
