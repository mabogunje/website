Yòrúdì is the project I envisioned when I decided to teach myself [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/). In the <mark>Languages section</mark> here, you will see that I'm a novice at my native tongue.
To help myself, I wanted an extensible dictionary. While I only completed a proof-of-concept, I learnt a lot about Scala & Yoruba in the process.
