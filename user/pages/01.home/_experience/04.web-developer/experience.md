I started working for the Drexel University CS dept. as an Undergrad. At the time the department was moving from [MediaWiki](http://www.mediawiki.org/) to [Drupal](http://www.drupal.org) so all my work involved Drupal customizations.

* On-demand development of Drupal templates, views, and other features.
* Content Management, Taxonomy, and Classification
* Data Migration
