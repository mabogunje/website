title: "About Me"

---

Software Engineer by day, Blogger, Poet, and Author by night, I spend my days writing everything from the convex comma, to highly complex code. I started creatively writing poetry at the age of 10. Now I creatively write <code>code</code>

Most of my professional career has involved *Customising [Content Management Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system)*, but my interests are varied and I am constantly acquiring new ones. Currently, I'm exploring [Arbitration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitration), and [Digital Marketing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_marketing).

I'm also working (ever so slowly) on a _Novel_, and I'm passively investigating <u>Behavioural Psychology</u> and <u>Natural Language Processing</u>, amongst other things.
