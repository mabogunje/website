Software Engineer and Data Analyst by day, Blogger, Poet and Author, by night,
I spend my days writing everything from the convex comma, to highly complex
code. More recently however, I have found myself engrossed in the technology
stacks and toolsets necessary to power business.

I began my professional career working on Websites and *Customising [Content Management Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system)*.
As a young developer, I tried my hand at Application Development, Quality Testing,
and as mentioned earlier Website Development. All of this, was in the U.S.

Eventually, I made my way back home to Nigeria, and started working at one of our
family businesses. Now I head the ICT team at Toki Mabogunje & Co. aka TMC, and am
responsible for all our technology decisions. Meanwhile, I have trained myself in
[Digital Marketing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/digital-marketing.asp), [Data Analytics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytics), and [E-Commerce](https://sell.amazon.com/learn/what-is-ecommerce#:~:text=questions%20about%20ecommerce-,What%20is%20ecommerce%3F,media%20to%20drive%20online%20sales).

Currently, I'm building out a new business called **TMC Insight Labs** to service local
Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), helping them grow by supporting their Digital Marketing
functions.
